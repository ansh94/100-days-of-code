# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 03, 2017
<!--##### (delete me or comment me out) --> 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Detail Activity for Popular Movies App and used Parcelable instead of Serializable to make it more efficient and fast. Also did some UI changes.

**Thoughts:** Great start for me. I learned about Parcelable in Android and how it is more efficient than Serializable by implementing in my app.

### Day 2: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added Settings Activity and used PreferenceFragment to sort movies by popular or top-rated and used SharedPreferences to remember the selected setting.

**Thoughts:** I got stuck for some time trying to figure out PreferencesFragment but in the end with the help of some tutorials and stackoverflow I managed to successfully implement it in my app :) Bring on day 3!!
