# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 03, 2017
<!--##### (delete me or comment me out) --> 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Detail Activity for Popular Movies App and used Parcelable instead of Serializable to make it more efficient and fast. Also did some UI changes.

**Thoughts:** Great start for me. I learned about Parcelable in Android and how it is more efficient than Serializable by implementing in my app.

### Day 2: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added Settings Activity and used PreferenceFragment to sort movies by popular or top-rated and used SharedPreferences to remember the selected setting.

**Thoughts:** I got stuck for some time trying to figure out PreferencesFragment but in the end with the help of some tutorials and stackoverflow I managed to successfully implement it in my app :) Bring on day 3!!

### Day 3: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Provided up navigation(back arrow) from MovieDetails Activity to the Main activity.

**Thoughts:** Not much progress today as I was out for almost the whole day celebrating Gurpurab but still managed to do a minor task in my app to keep myself in the flow.I will make it up by doing an extra hour of coding on Day 4!!

Cleaned up some old unused code and did the finishing touches before submitting the project for Udacity Review.

**Thoughts:** Finally I managed to submit my first project of the Android Nanodegree. Hoping to get a good feedback which meets all the specifications.

### Day 7: January 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned about FastAdapter(by mikepenz) and how it is much more faster to use than traditional RecyclerView and Adapter. Also it has a lot of features which can be implemented easily without much boilerplate code. 

**Thoughts:** I will use FastAdapter for all my upcoming projects!!

### Day 8: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Watched Udacity videos on Activity Lifecycle and learned about all its methods. Also learned about onSaveInstanceState to save states when rotating the device(or emulator). Reinforced my learning by doing coding exercises on these topics.

**Thoughts:** Activity Lifecycle is a very important part of an Android app and we should prepare our apps for untimely deaths or termination by using onSaveInstanceState wherever necessary.

### Day 9: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Loaders and AsyncTaskLoaders and how they are much more useful and efficient than traditional AsyncTask. They prevent duplication of background threads and eliminates zombie activities when screen is rotated. Implemented them in Github Search Toy app and changed sunshine app from asynctask to asynctaskloader. Now sunshine fetches weather data using a AsyncTaskLoader :smile: 

**Thoughts:** Saying goodbye to AsyncTask and hello to AsyncTaskLoader from today and in all my future projects :metal:

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
